Cemetery, 864 River Rd, Manotick, ON K4M 0E2 --> RRMC? river road manotick cemetery?

Graveyard Project:

    I would like to ask for permission to do a study of the grave monuments in [name of cemetery], as part of my coursework. This would involve photographing and measuring the stones. I will not be interfering with the stones or any of the planting or landscape. I believe it should not take me more than three or four days. The information I collect will be used in my class and ideally will be online if you agree. I can put you in contact with my Professor, Dr. Shawn Graham, if you have any questions about that aspect of the work.
    
    1. sketch the graveyard:
        -print out satilite image
        -number and mark each stone on the map
        -measure and mark any stones that are hidden from satilite view
        -get coordinates
        -note landmarks if any
    2. visit graveyard to collect data:
        -fill out a sheet for each stone
        -take pictures
    3. record data online
    
issues with kobotoolbox

    -inscription box is a one line text box instead of a multiline text box
    -only allows one image to be uploaded per stone
    -there is width and hight of base but no thickness
