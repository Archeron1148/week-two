Mortuary Archaeology

PODCAST:
    
    Graveyard Project:
    1. permission
    2. recording data
        -think about the assumptions in the recording program (developed in UK)

    Robyn Lacy:
    -'the good death of white settlers'
    -whitewashing of indigenous and african decendant burial rituals
    -concrete bad for gravestones

Cemetery, 864 River Rd, Manotick, ON K4M 0E2 --> RRMC - river road manotick cemetery

Graveyard Project:

    I would like to ask for permission to do a study of the grave monuments in [name of cemetery], as part of my coursework. This would involve photographing and measuring the stones. I will not be interfering with the stones or any of the planting or landscape. I believe it should not take me more than three or four days. The information I collect will be used in my class and ideally will be online if you agree. I can put you in contact with my Professor, Dr. Shawn Graham, if you have any questions about that aspect of the work.
    
    1. sketch the graveyard:
        -print out satilite image
        -number and mark each stone on the map
        -measure and mark any stones that are hidden from satilite view
        -get coordinates
        -note landmarks if any
    2. visit graveyard to collect data:
        -fill out a sheet for each stone
        -take pictures
    3. record data online
    
issues with kobotoolbox

    -inscription box is a one line text box instead of a multiline text box
    -only allows one image to be uploaded per stone
    -there is width and hight of base but no thickness
    
    -Individuals form only has years but no months of age
    
Ethical Challenges in Digital Public Archaeology
https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.13/

    **As Fernández (2015: 63) notes, our existing ethical codes are based on a universal assumption that everyone working in the field of archaeology possesses the same cultural experiences and values, and all support the desire to protect archaeological material and sites with the ethical stance of the professional archaeologist primarily dedicated to the preservation of archaeological knowledge above anything else.**
    we need to acknowledge that the growth in use of digital technologies, the internet and of digital mobile devices and applications has not yet led to a correspondingly increased concern for ethical standards and behaviour within the field of digital public archaeology, 
    Privacy, digital surveilance, online abuse
    As scholars, we cannot ignore the reality that, just because this data is in the public arena, it is also open and free to use, and that permission has been granted for its harvesting, analysis and dissemination. 
    There are serious, if overlooked, ethical concerns about privacy, for both individuals and researchers, when creators of digital projects use third party platforms for digital public archaeology, and which gather and monitor personal user data.
    Public interest in archaeological research can elicit outrage as much as fascination, which is assisted in volume and velocity by the affordances of digital technologies. 
    In an era of nationalist politics, hate speech and fake news, the online baiting and abuse of archaeological experts can have a serious impact on personal safety, given the far right’s interest in evolution, ancient DNA, the medieval period and archaeological perspectives on national identity, to name a few. 
    Protecting participants and digital communities from online abuse, or ‘trolling’ is an important ethical obligation, especially in contexts where non-mainstream opinions are elicited, politically relevant archaeological sites are discussed, or controversial subjects are presented for public consumption, such as contested heritage, redevelopment on archaeological sites, or even the relationship between astronomy and megalithic alignment. 
    **Ethics are as Gnecco (2015: 1) points out ‘reified, as if it were an anthropological universal’ and are always dependent on context and historical and social background of the site, work, authors and participants in the project in hand.**
        -What would you include if I asked you to start drafting ethical guidance for our graveyard project?
        -It's not a 'digital public archaeology' in the sense that Richardson is describing, but it could be quite easily. All we'd have to do is share the link to the recording form, and put the data online in the open…
        -Can you tie the issues discussed here with the burial archaeology projects you read about this week?
        -Graham
    *As archaeological work increasingly takes place in the commercial sector in the UK for example, the archaeologists’ voice may be usurped by the needs of the developers, who may have little interest in developing ethical practices and may in fact prefer to concentrate on bottom line costs.*
    The narratives that are created by professional archaeologists and communicated through digital technologies, or those digital projects that create content or visualizations through more community focused inclusive practices, cannot be extricated from the diverse contemporary and historical social, political and economic contexts in which archaeology is practiced. 
    It is clear then, that the analysis of archaeological data, the creation of a historical narrative or digital visualization is a conscious choice, and as well as political act. These decisions and the challenges that emerge within these interactions could indeed challenge archaeological authority and these challenges require an ethical framework.
        -What political factors might be at play within the parameters of the graveyard project? -Graham
    Our professional bodies, employers and university departments cannot excuse themselves from ethical concerns when human beings, living communities and socio-political tensions, are intrinsically entwined with our work in the digital field.
