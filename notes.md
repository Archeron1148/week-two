Mortuary Archaeology

PODCAST:
    
    Graveyard Project:
    1. permission
    2. recording data
        -think about the assumptions in the recording program (developed in UK)

    Robyn Lacy:
    -'the good death of white settlers'
    -whitewashing of indigenous and african decendant burial rituals
    -concrete bad for gravestones

Cemetery, 864 River Rd, Manotick, ON K4M 0E2 --> RRMC - river road manotick cemetery

Graveyard Project:

    I would like to ask for permission to do a study of the grave monuments in [name of cemetery], as part of my coursework. This would involve photographing and measuring the stones. I will not be interfering with the stones or any of the planting or landscape. I believe it should not take me more than three or four days. The information I collect will be used in my class and ideally will be online if you agree. I can put you in contact with my Professor, Dr. Shawn Graham, if you have any questions about that aspect of the work.
    
    1. sketch the graveyard:
        -print out satilite image
        -number and mark each stone on the map
        -measure and mark any stones that are hidden from satilite view
        -get coordinates
        -note landmarks if any
    2. visit graveyard to collect data:
        -fill out a sheet for each stone
        -take pictures
    3. record data online
    
issues with kobotoolbox

    -inscription box is a one line text box instead of a multiline text box
    -only allows one image to be uploaded per stone
    -there is width and hight of base but no thickness
    
    -Individuals form only has years but no months of age
    
Ethical Challenges in Digital Public Archaeology
https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.13/

    **As Fernández (2015: 63) notes, our existing ethical codes are based on a universal assumption that everyone working in the field of archaeology possesses the same cultural experiences and values, and all support the desire to protect archaeological material and sites with the ethical stance of the professional archaeologist primarily dedicated to the preservation of archaeological knowledge above anything else.**
    we need to acknowledge that the growth in use of digital technologies, the internet and of digital mobile devices and applications has not yet led to a correspondingly increased concern for ethical standards and behaviour within the field of digital public archaeology, 
    Privacy, digital surveilance, online abuse
    As scholars, we cannot ignore the reality that, just because this data is in the public arena, it is also open and free to use, and that permission has been granted for its harvesting, analysis and dissemination. 
    There are serious, if overlooked, ethical concerns about privacy, for both individuals and researchers, when creators of digital projects use third party platforms for digital public archaeology, and which gather and monitor personal user data.
    Public interest in archaeological research can elicit outrage as much as fascination, which is assisted in volume and velocity by the affordances of digital technologies. 
    In an era of nationalist politics, hate speech and fake news, the online baiting and abuse of archaeological experts can have a serious impact on personal safety, given the far right’s interest in evolution, ancient DNA, the medieval period and archaeological perspectives on national identity, to name a few. 
    Protecting participants and digital communities from online abuse, or ‘trolling’ is an important ethical obligation, especially in contexts where non-mainstream opinions are elicited, politically relevant archaeological sites are discussed, or controversial subjects are presented for public consumption, such as contested heritage, redevelopment on archaeological sites, or even the relationship between astronomy and megalithic alignment. 
    **Ethics are as Gnecco (2015: 1) points out ‘reified, as if it were an anthropological universal’ and are always dependent on context and historical and social background of the site, work, authors and participants in the project in hand.**
        -What would you include if I asked you to start drafting ethical guidance for our graveyard project?
        -It's not a 'digital public archaeology' in the sense that Richardson is describing, but it could be quite easily. All we'd have to do is share the link to the recording form, and put the data online in the open…
        -Can you tie the issues discussed here with the burial archaeology projects you read about this week?
        -Graham
    **As archaeological work increasingly takes place in the commercial sector in the UK for example, the archaeologists’ voice may be usurped by the needs of the developers, who may have little interest in developing ethical practices and may in fact prefer to concentrate on bottom line costs.**
    The narratives that are created by professional archaeologists and communicated through digital technologies, or those digital projects that create content or visualizations through more community focused inclusive practices, cannot be extricated from the diverse contemporary and historical social, political and economic contexts in which archaeology is practiced. 
    It is clear then, that the analysis of archaeological data, the creation of a historical narrative or digital visualization is a conscious choice, and as well as political act. These decisions and the challenges that emerge within these interactions could indeed challenge archaeological authority and these challenges require an ethical framework.
        -What political factors might be at play within the parameters of the graveyard project? -Graham
    Our professional bodies, employers and university departments cannot excuse themselves from ethical concerns when human beings, living communities and socio-political tensions, are intrinsically entwined with our work in the digital field. 
    
Digital Archaeological Ethics: Successes and Failures in Disciplinary Attention
https://journal.caa-international.org/articles/10.5334/jcaa.24/

    practitioners have clear expectations of how the conventional (hereafter referred to as analog) archaeological aspects of their work should be considered in terms of ethics, but are largely left to their own devices as regards ethical decision-making for the specifically digital portions of their work.
    the concerns of universities and research bodies who control such reviews lie within a neoliberal manifestation of corporatized responsibility: the duty of care to participants is more often accomplished through a process that presents as professional accountability, but is in reality an attempt to deflect liability away from organizations and onto individual researchers. (This process often results in a conflation of meeting an ethical mandate with meeting a legal mandate.)
    For the purposes of this analysis, digital archaeology is defined as archaeology largely or exclusively facilitated through computer-based tools or analytical approaches, or archaeology concerned with virtual or digital representations of space or materiality, or archaeology concerned with information technology or internet-based data sources. 
        -In what ways is this definition broader than what we're doing in this class? Narrower? Why might that matter? -Graham
    **The first area in which digital archaeology is operating without consensus-led ethical guidelines is in the use of digital technology and digital tool usage. In effect, much of digital archaeology as undertaken by both dedicated practitioners and more casual users operates using what are referred to as ‘black box’ technologies or methods.**
    As an example, teaching students to conduct aspects of field survey with digital tools often fails to rest on a foundation of full understanding of the reasons for the use of those tools.
        -And now consider our graveyard project. - Graham
    The creation of research designs that rely on black box technologies cannot effectively address whether those designs are meeting the ethical standards agreed upon by consensus within archaeology as a field. By its very nature, if a system cannot be understood by its user, then its user cannot ensure that a formalized ethical compliance is being met, let alone if an aspirational ethical standard is being met.
    For every tool, the question should be asked: ‘Is the use of this tool in a digital form adding value to the project that is balanced by the ethics of its use?’ 
        -ask these of our graveyard project. - Graham
    Just because something can be accomplished faster, or easier, with a digital approach does not mean that the ethics of that approach are equal. 
        -Bill Caraher's 'Slow Archaeology' pushes back against the 'efficiency' of digital media from the perspective grounded in the aesthetics of knowledge, and the ethics of labour. - Graham
    The exclusion of indigenous populations from these discussions and the omission of their input mirrors past practices in archaeology that have been previously determined to be ethically unsound, belonging to a past age.
    While it is almost certain that varying indigenous groups will have different opinions on how digital tools, methodologies, and systems of digital storage should be applied (and not applied) to data derived from their cultural forbearers, this potential variance should not in itself stand in the way of attempting to achieve ethical consensus. Instead, the relative youth of digital archaeology should be viewed as an opportunity to create partnerships and relationships between archaeologists and their non-archaeologist collaborators that are, from the outset, grounded in shared values and respect and directed by community desires and rights.
    First, archaeologists are often teaching students to use digital tools without teaching the accompanying ethical consideration of those tools. Second, students are often being asked to be performative with digital tools and in the use of digital methodologies without regard for the ethics or the implications of that performative behavior.
    The digital record, however, holds and preserves the early impressions of performative experiences in archaeological education where they may be removed from the overall context of iterative learning and left contextless, and harmful to professional opportunities. 
    The use of a digital tool that cannot be understood by the user, or a digital method whose analytic processes cannot be explained by the user, is an inherently unethical choice.
    Indigenous peoples especially stand to be harmed as colonizer-created data is distributed online and stored in inaccessible data repositories out of their control.
    
Public Engagement through Burial Landscapes: Cupids and Ferryland, Newfoundland
https://via.hypothes.is/http://revistas.jasarqueologia.es/index.php/APJournal/article/download/146/162

    The burial landscapes at the case study sites, London  and  Bristol  Company’s  Cupids  Plantation  (established  in  1610) and George Calvert’s Colony of Avalon at Ferryland (1621) (Cell  1969;  1982),  are  known  to  history  through  documents  recording  the  deaths  of  settlers,  but  these  have  not  endured  as  known features within the modern landscape.
    **Before proceeding, it is essential to reiterate that the burial sites discussed in this paper are associated with colonial settlements in Newfoundland.  No  Indigenous  burials  were  explored  or  disturbed  during  this  project,  although  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  these  colonial  settlements  were  built  on  the  traditional  territory  of the Beothuk people. With this research, I suggest an aspect of the  burial  landscape  that  could  be  employed  to  open  discussions  on mortality at historic settlement sites; however, the study of an Indigenous  burial  ground  requires  an  understanding  of  different  ethical dimensions to archaeological practices. In current practice, Indigenous burial grounds should not be investigated without the express consent and support of the Indigenous community, as the impacts  of  colonial  archaeological  research  are  still  palpable  in  North  America  today  (e.g.  McGee  2008;  Phillips  and  Allen  2011;  Giles and Williams 2016).**
    While  people  are  often  fascinated  by  burial  practices  throughout  history,  today  we  in the Global West deal with our own mortality in an often-indirect way. In a period where death and dying in the Western world are often  kept  away  behind  the  closed  doors  of  funeral  homes  and  hospitals, archaeology can offer a less visceral way to interact with mortality through the long-dead.
    Asking  questions  such  as  why,  where,  how,  and  when  might  people  have  been  buried  in  specific  areas  allows archaeologists and visitors to gain a new awareness of the space that they are all occupying in that moment. Discussing death and burial with visitors at public archaeology projects such as Cupids and Ferryland is something which should be encouraged freely, and archaeologists  should  continue  to  use  their  position  as  so  called  ‘death dealers’ (Meyers and Williams 2014: 155) to promote open discussions  about  mortality.  
    Archaeologists are uniquely situated between two groups; death professionals  who  deal  regularly  with  the  modern  dead  and  the  public  who  encounter  death  in  a  subtler  way.  As  directly  argued  by  Giles  and  Williams  (2016)  we  deal  indirectly  with  themes  of  mortality  every  day  as  researchers  and  field  technicians,  and as  a  result,  we  have  an  excellent  platform  with  which  to  open  a  discussion about death and dying with visitors through the medium of death and dying throughout history. Exploring human mortality through  archaeology  can  be  seen  as  a  gentle  way  to  ease  into  discussions of modern death, allowing visitors to ask questions that they might otherwise feel uncomfortable asking, facilitated by the open and engaging discussion already taking place. 

Open Data as Public Archaeology: The Monumental Archive Project 
https://via.hypothes.is/http://revistas.jasarqueologia.es/index.php/APJournal/article/download/152/165

    The  fields  of  archaeology  and  history  have  similarly  been transformed, consumed with redeveloping methods for archiving, accessing, and preserving digital records (Tibbo 2003: 9). The values and  protocols  of  open  science1  have  especially  pushed  scholars  to  critically reflect on the accessibility of not only interpretations, but also on data (Kansa 2012; Lucas 2012: 216)—for professionals and for the public alike. 
    hese objections intersect with the diverse ways in which people understand and connect with death and the dead. 
        -This is also true of cemeteries that are more or less 'abandoned' or rather, not being used for internment any longer. The extant surrounding community might be very different than the community during the cemetery's use, so the questions can become very complicated. - Graham
    Altogether, data  created  through  commercial,  academic,  and  community avenues continues to be dominated by white historical narratives, often restricting the (perceived) usefulness of data and its relevance to contemporary research and understandings of the past. 
    
    
    
    
perhaps one part of the reason its so hard to define ethics for digital archaeology is because nobody is sure what digital archaeology is in the first place
technologies are increasingly becoming 'black-boxes,' as they become more and more complex it begins harder and harder to truely understand how they work from head to toe

"The creation of research designs that rely on black box technologies cannot effectively address whether those designs are meeting the ethical standards agreed upon by consensus within archaeology as a field. By its very nature, if a system cannot be understood by its user, then its user cannot ensure that a formalized ethical compliance is being met, let alone if an aspirational ethical standard is being met. " - L Meghan Dennis
apply this to digital archaeology as a whole i.e. how can we do digital archaeology ethically if we arent totally sure about what it is
