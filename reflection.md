Week 2 Journal - Archeron1148

>Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you

"The creation of research designs that rely on black box technologies cannot effectively address whether those designs are meeting the ethical standards agreed upon by consensus within archaeology as a field. By its very nature, if a system cannot be understood by its user, then its user cannot ensure that a formalized ethical compliance is being met, let alone if an aspirational ethical standard is being met." - L Meghan Dennis, Digital Archaeological Ethics: Successes and Failures in Disciplinary Attention

As technology becomes more and more complex and systems are more commonly being built upon other systems (high level programming languages with libraries for example), it becomes increasingly harder to understand how it actually works at a base level, and if you cannot understand the technology, you cannot always be sure it operates ethically.
How can we be sure digital archaeology is being done ethically if we don't fully understand the technology?
Moreover, how can we be sure digital archaeology is being done ethically if we have not built up a full theory of the ethics of digital archaeology?
How can we begin to construct this theory if we cannot say for sure what is and isn't digital archaeology, or even whether there are more than one digital archaeologies?

>discuss the ethical issues that this weekâ€™s work presents to you as you go out into your community. Are there ethical or physical dangers for you? What are the challenges for doing digital archaeology in your own particular context? How does the work I am asking you to do present ethical or moral challenges for your community? 

Any physical dangers I believe I can say with certainty were negated by taking a trusted friend with me to the cemetery I went to.

The most obvious ethical challenge for the graveyard project I think has to do with obtaining permission to record the stones. To do this, I knocked on the door on the house closest to the cemetery (River Road cemetery near Manotick) - he told me that the city maintains the location and he takes care of it himself. After explaining the that it was for my university course work, I was given *his* permission to enter the site and record the stones. It still poses issues though because obviously he can't speak for everyone involved with those gravestones - that is, all living relatives of the deceased or even unrelated people who put up the monuments.

Another issue I have been thinking about is that at this point in the course I'm not totally confident I can say concretely what the data collected will be used for or where it will finally end up. Without reading ahead, I know it will be used for some aspects of the course work, we will be studying the data as a class, and it may be available online - but this is all still awfully vague.

Finally, I would like to talk about a couple issues in the recording of the data itself.
First off (and I know this is all a part of the course), the way the graveyard recording code sheets are already makes a few assumptions about the data through limiting choices for inputted data: the most blaring and obvious example (it was the first thing I noticed when looking at it) was that in the section for denomination it only lists the abrahamic religions (to varying levels of differentiation) alongside one code for 'pet cemetery': I looked over it about three times looking for "denomination unknown" but did not find it so I ended up leaving it blank for most of the stones as most of them had no obvious religious symbols.
Secondly, I felt that there were even some assumptions that the code sheets had of myself! for example the assumption that I can actually tell the difference between smooth and machine cut tooling or that I know what all the different monument materials look like (google helped some obviously, but not completely) --> in other (more serious) words, without a trained eye I cannot be confident I have recording the data correctly.
Both of these issues (assumptions about the data inherent to the code sheets and my untrained eye) present worries for the accuracy of my data, and without accurate data I cannot be sure my conclusions will be totally valid, and that for me constitutes a slight ethical violation as well as an issue of practical methodology.
